# Release validation: 0.3.0

Checked on a headless Linux server on 2026-09-12.

- Python 3.12: 131 deterministic tests covering legacy search behavior, all new question frameworks,
  source pagination, raw retrieval budgets, research stages, stale evidence, quote/identity gates,
  full-text retries, PDF pages/XML tables, export escaping, and package contents.
- Ruff and offline bundle checks pass. Wheel, source distribution, and reproducible plugin ZIP build.
  All three archives were inspected for accidental session files, credentials, and research runs.
- Codex CLI 0.154.0 accepts the Git marketplace format and installs/enables both shared skills
  through the plugin bundle. The Codex plugin manifest validator passes.
- Claude Code 2.1.268 strict validation accepts the plugin and marketplace manifests.
- Hermes 0.21.2, source commit `eec131b7163a8f287a9bddfc8ba11e6bd07ac49e`: the actual portable
  loader discovers both skills with no diagnostics, and Plugin Doctor passes runtime discovery,
  parsing, import, and registration. Hermes was tested from its source checkout; no desktop was used.

Live checks retrieved Europe PMC literature, acquired an OA XML article (31 source segments),
resolved its DOI through Crossref, and retrieved a ClinicalTrials.gov record. Europe PMC's citation
traversal endpoint returned HTTP 503 with a maintenance message after retries. That live component
remains subject to provider availability; its parsing/provenance contract passes offline tests.
Search and export artifacts disclose failed, omitted, capped, or unverified sources.

The test report uses synthetic evidence. It validates workflow behavior and provenance controls,
not medical accuracy or equivalence to independent human screening, appraisal, or a formal review.
